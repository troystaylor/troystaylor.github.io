In this blog post, I'm not going to reinvent the wheel; I'm going to point you to some other developers who are already sharing some excellent content on creating custom connectors.

To start, the best place to learn about custom connectors is from [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/). They have several tutorials on getting started and tons of guides for setting up specific authentication types. They do a great job of providing screenshots to walk you through the interface and teaching the concepts of building out a connector from an existing API.

If you would like to learn about creating a custom connector through a demo with an expert (and one hell of a person), check out [Daniel Laskewitz](https://twitter.com/laskewitz)'s session at the Digital Cloud Summit, [Demo Extravaganza - Create your own custom connectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MTnWLPfa_o). In the hour-and-a-half video, he has a 1-minute introduction before spending the remaining time doing a 3-minute talk about custom connectors and then working "by hand" to create a couple of connectors. It's worthwhile to watch when you are getting started building custom connectors and once again when you have gotten past some of the interface challenges and want to understand them better.

And if you are a person who likes to read over videos, check out [Kristine Kolodziejski](https://www.twitter.com/kristinemk)'s [3-part series on her blog](https://kristinekolodziejski.com/blog/create-a-custom-connector-part-one/). Focused around integrating Power Platform with the Placedog API, she'll take you step-by-step (with screenshots) through building a custom connector in an afternoon, with explanations to help you realize the concepts of what's going on.

The series I link to is just one type of her content; she is very active on Twitter and is always pointing people to free resources to help grow their development careers and expand their Power Platform skills.

Finally, a short video to introduce you to the Power Platform Connectors CLI by [Microsoft Power Automate](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG98S4lL7nwlN8dxSF322bA) which will help you on the way to creating a connector to submit to the repo and get certification.

These resources have all helped me learn to create custom connectors and I hope they will help you too.
